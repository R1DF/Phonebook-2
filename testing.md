# Testing
This file contains information on how you can download the program and be able to edit it. Mac and Linux users can also download the program this way, but it's not advised to. <br>

## Steps
First, we need to download Python itself.
1. Go to [this link](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Python will automatically detect your OS, click Download Python 3.8.1 or higher. Downloading earlier versions is not recommended as it can bring errors.<br>
    * Do not download Python versions which have 2 at the start! Python 2 works differently than Python 3 and it **will** give your program errors!

Now, we should download the files.
1. Download these files:
    * `phonebook2.py`
    * `prompts.py`

2. Download the files in the `docs` folder, which are:
    * `page1.txt`
    * `page2.txt`
    * `page3.txt`
    * `page4.txt`

3. Make a custom folder in which all files are downloaded.
4. Do not skip this step. Make a folder **exactly** called `docs` in the main folder. Put all `page` .txt files in it.

If you have followed these steps correctly, you have downloaded the program via using its source code. <br>
To run the program, follow these steps:
1. Search for and run `IDLE`. It's a program that came with your Python installation which allows you to run .py files.
2. Open the`phonebook2.py` file in your main folder.
3. Hit F5(sometimes, hold down Fn too) or click Run > Run Module.
