July 2 2020

## What is this program?
Phonebook 2 program is a lightweight and simple program that works exactly like a phonebook, given by the title. <br>
You can add, delete and edit people in your phonebook. You can also export and import a phonebook to save/open your data. <br>
There are also the docs, viewable text files that help the user find out how to use the program. These files can be viewed by the Phonebook 2 program itself.

## Downloads
Phonebook 2 is available for Windows users, and the program can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VmVRsAqnntm2yZx5P3M0Aga0d7F9qdGN/view?usp=sharing). <br>
There is no Mac or Linux file, because the creator currently doesn't know how to freeze the program to Mac/Linux. <br> <br>

However, it is possible to download for Mac and Linux by downloading Python first, to see more go to `testing.md`.
